IMPORTANT:
We will not incorporate the Saving of Records of Learn About Statistics
because it will cause issue of Related Questions...... So knowning we have not incorporated it ...


Why we should keep "New Topic" Button (Your Current Setup):
User: "What is GDP?"
Bot: "GDP is Gross Domestic Product..."
Shows Related Questions:
  1. What are components of GDP?
  2. How is GDP calculated?
  3. What are limitations of GDP?
  4. How does GDP affect economy?

User: Doesn't click related question
Instead, goes to Quick Help dropdown
Selects from dropdown: "What are the components of GDP?"

Bot receives:
  Previous Context: "What is GDP? → GDP is..."
  Current Question: "What are the components of GDP?"

Bot responds: "As I mentioned earlier, GDP is... The components are C, I, G, and (X-M)..."
✅ Context is preserved! Even though user didn't click related question.
